Where is customerid originating from?

>The `customerid` originates from multiple sources, including the columns `main.customers_final.customerid` and `wh_db.DimCustomer.customerid`. It also appears in `main.customers.customerid` and is associated with the table `wh_db_stage.CustomerMgmt`.

effectivedate in which tables it's present? is there some kind of transformation involved? where could I find it in my relational database?

>The `effectivedate` field is present in several tables within your relational database, including: - `main.customers_final` - `wh_db.DimCompany` - `wh_db.DimAccount` - `wh_db.DimBroker` - `wh_db.DimSecurity` - `wh_db.DimCustomer` There are also transformations involving `effectivedate`: 1. A **RENAME** transformation where it is referenced as `c.effectivedate`. 2. An **EXPRESSION_CONCAT** transformation that compares two effective dates: `if(a.effectivedate < c.effectivedate, c.effectivedate, a.effectivedate)`. You can find this field directly in the listed tables or as part of the described transformations.

looking at the process called procpect_load, could you propose some data quality checks for this process?

>I don't know the answer to your question about data quality checks for the company_load process.

process called company_load, from where does this process load information? what kind of information? could you give a example values?

>The `company_load` process loads information from two main sources: 1. **From `wh_db_stage.FinWire`**: - **Columns**: - `recdate` (DATE): Likely the record date of the financial data. - `value` (VARCHAR): Contains financial-related information in text format. - **Example values**: - `recdate`: `2023-10-15` - `value`: `"XYZ Corp,Q3 Earnings,$1.2B"` 2. **From `wh_db.industry`**: - **Column**: - `in_name` (VARCHAR): Stores industry names. - **Example value**: - `in_name`: `"Technology"` This suggests the process loads financial records (dates and values) along with industry classifications.
