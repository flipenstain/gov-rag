It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security.             KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21× in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100×."",2024-08,2024-11-26 18:03:34,2024-11-26 18:03:34,2024-11-26 18:03:34,3841-3854,,12.0,17.0,,Proc.

This systematic review examines a selection of recent publications to understand how KGs are currently being used in eXplainable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we design a framework and divide the use of KGs into four categories: extracting features, extracting relationships, constructing KGs, and KG reasoning. We also identify where KGs are mostly used in eXplainable AI systems (pre-model, in-model, and post-model) according to the aforementioned categories.

The KGSDN framework seamlessly integrates the knowledge graph and object detection network and employs an attention-based network to evaluate the semantic distance between objects.

Entity Alignment (EA) is the problem of detecting such overlapping information among KGs that refer to the same real-world entities. Recent works have shown a great potential in exploiting KG embeddings for the task of EA, with most works focusing on the structural representation of entities (i.e., entity neighborhoods) in a KG and some works also exploiting the available factual information of entities (e.g., their names and associated literal values). However, real-word KGs exhibit high levels of structural and semantic heterogeneity, making EA a challenging task in which most existing methods struggle to achieve good results.

However, other crucial stages of these pipelines such as dataset selection, feature engineering, and model optimization for deployment have received less attention. Improving efficiency of end-to-end AI pipelines requires metadata of past executions of AI pipelines and all their stages. Regenerating metadata history by re-executing existing AI pipelines is computationally challenging and impractical. To address this issue, we propose to source AI pipeline metadata from open-source platforms such as Papers-with-Code, OpenML, and Hugging Face. However, integrating and unifying the varying terminologies and data formats from these diverse sources is a challenge. In this study, we present a solution by introducing Common Metadata Ontology (CMO) which is used to construct an extensive AI Pipeline Metadata Knowledge Graph (AIMKG) consisting of 1.6 million pipelines. Through semantic enhancements, the pipeline metadata in AIMKG is also enriched for downstream tasks such as search and recommendation of AI pipelines. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on AIMKG to search and recommend relevant pipelines to user query. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a custom aggregation model that outperforms other baselines by achieving a retrieval accuracy (R@1) of 76.3%. Our qualitative analysis shows that AIMKG-based recommender retrieved relevant pipelines in 78% of test cases compared to the state-of-the-art MLSchema-based recommender which retrieved relevant responses in 51% of the cases.

Recently, ETL was replaced by the more comprehensive acronym, data integration (DI). DI describes the process of extracting and combining data from a variety of data source formats, transforming that data into a uniﬁed data model representation and loading it into a data store. This is done in the context of a variety of scenarios, such as data acquisition for business intelligence, analytics and data warehousing, but also synchronization of data between operational applications, data migrations and conversions, master data management, enterprise data sharing and delivery of data services in a service-oriented architecture context, amongst others. With these scenarios relying on up-to-date information it is critical to implement a highly performing, scalable and easy to maintain data integration system. This is especially important as the complexity, variety and volume of data is constantly increasing and performance of data integration systems is becoming very critical. Despite the signiﬁcance of having a highly performing DI system, there has been no industry standard for measuring and comparing their performance. The TPC, acknowledging this void, has released TPC-DI, an innovative benchmark for data integration.

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory.

To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have been proposed, which retrieve relevant information from external sources to inform their responses. However, existing RAG methods typically focus on a single type of external data, such as vectorized text database or knowledge graphs, and cannot well handle real-world questions on semi-structured data containing both text and relational information. To bridge this gap, we introduce PASemiQA, a novel approach that jointly leverages text and relational information in semi-structured data to answer questions.

However, despite their generally good performance, the adoption of LLM-generated solutions and artefacts prompts concerns about their correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness. Objective: This paper aims to address the concerns associated with the use of LLMs in RE activities. Specifically, it seeks to develop a roadmap that leverages formal methods (FMs) to provide guarantees of correctness, fairness, and trustworthiness when LLMs are utilised in RE. Symmetrically, it aims to explore how LLMs can be employed to make FMs more accessible. Methods: We use two sets of examples to show the current limits of FMs when used in software development and of LLMs when used for RE tasks. The highlighted limitations are addressed by proposing two roadmaps grounded in the current literature and technologies. Results: The proposed examples show the potential and limits of FMs in supporting software development and of LLMs when used for RE tasks. The initial investigation into how these limitations can be overcome has been concretised in two detailed roadmaps for the RE and, more largely, the software engineering community.

Recent models take advantage of pre-trained generative language models for this task in the Seq2Seq framework. However, treating SQL as a sequence of inputs to the pre-trained models is not optimal. In this work, we put forward a new SQL intermediate representation called EzSQL to align SQL with the natural language text sequence. EzSQL simplifies the SQL queries and brings them closer to natural language text by modifying operators and keywords, which can usually be described in natural language. EzSQL also removes the need for set operators. Our proposed SQL-to-text generation model uses EzSQL as the input to a pre-trained generative language model for generating the text descriptions. We demonstrate that our model is an effective state-of-the-art method to generate text narrations from SQL queries on the WikiSQL and Spider datasets.

Its journey typically flows from collection to transport, storage, management and processing. While best practices and regulations guide data management and protection, recent events have underscored its vulnerability. Academic research and commercial data handling have been marred by scandals, revealing the brittleness of data management. Data, despite its importance, is susceptible to undue disclosures, leaks, losses, manipulation, or fabrication. These incidents often occur without visibility or accountability, necessitating a systematic structure for safe, honest, and auditable data management. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Honest Computing as the practice and approach that emphasizes transparency, integrity, and ethical behaviour within the realm of computing and technology. It ensures that computer systems and software operate honestly and reliably without hidden agendas, biases, or unethical practices. It enables privacy and confidentiality of data and code by design and by default. We also introduce a reference framework to achieve demonstrable data lineage and provenance, contrasting it with Secure Computing, a related but differently-orientated form of computing. At its core, Honest Computing leverages Trustless Computing, Confidential Computing, Distributed Computing, Cryptography and AAA security concepts. Honest Computing opens new ways of creating technology-based processes and workflows which permit the migration of regulatory frameworks for data protection from principle-based approaches to rule-based ones.

However, the complexity of the multi-chain data marketplace, including factors such as data credibility, trust environment, data ownership, and relationship complexity, poses significant challenges to construct data lineages. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a data lineage construction method for multi-chain data marketplaces. This method mainly involves the following three steps: Firstly, map data assets to Data Non-Fungible Token (DataNFT) and use referable NFT (rNFT) to record data lineage. Secondly, when data assets require cross-chain transfer, the transfer message of DataNFT is broadcasted through the interchain NFT protocol, without the need for actual cross-chain transfer. Finally, we add weights to the data lineage link, enabling us to quickly locate problematic data based on weight sorting during data auditing. We have implemented a system prototype of this method and verified its effectiveness through experiments. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme not only ensures the correctness and completeness of data lineages, but also effectively reduces audit costs."",2024-05,2025-03-08 16:01:47,2025-03-08 16:01:47,2025-03-08 16:01:47,2110-2115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2768-1904,,C:\Users\kasutaja\Zotero\storage\K6466ZJ8\Zhao et al. - 2024 - Data Lineage Construction Method for Multi-Chain-B.pdf,,,Costs"; Complexity theory; Access control; cross-chain; data lineage; data marketplace; Federated learning; Nonfungible tokens; Protocols; Prototypes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 27th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kokkuvõtte tegemisel tekkis viga.;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, suitable methodologies and tools supporting DP design are still scarce. The emerging body of practitioner literature mostly focuses on analytics-based products and their technical design and architecture but lacks a more comprehensive product perspective on data. To address this gap, we propose the Data Product Canvas (DPC) as a visual inquiry tool that supports cross-functional teams in understanding, designing, and analyzing DPs. The DPC was developed in an iterative design science process involving focus groups with 15 global companies and was demonstrated for selected DPs. Building on the core ideas of the Business Model Canvas, the DPC outlines the critical elements for designing DPs focusing on three key themes: desirability from the customer perspective, feasibility from the technical perspective, and viability from an economic perspective. The DPC instantiates the design principles for visual inquiry tools and comprises a conceptual model, shared visualization, and directions for use. The DPC is the first step toward a systematic approach and shared language in designing DPs in ways that technical experts and business users understand."",2023,2025-03-11 11:39:20,2025-03-11 11:39:20,,191-205,,,,,,Data Product Canvas,,,,,Springer Nature Switzerland,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\kasutaja\Zotero\storage\VSSQY2CJ\Hasan and Legner - 2023 - Data Product Canvas A Visual Inquiry Tool Support.pdf,,,Data Product Canvas"; Data Product Design;" Visual Inquiry Tools,""Gerber, Aurona";" Baskerville, Richard"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kokkuvõtte tegemisel tekkis viga.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Data cleansing is a fundamental component of evaluating data governance, which focuses on quality and is an essential step before creating data analytics services. This paper introduces an automated framework for ensuring data quality using statistical and ML methods in banking, highlighting its objectives, functionality, and methodological advancements. The novel proposed approach focuses on proving the necessity of data quality assessment before training the ML models. In the evaluation of data quality, the outliers are detected using three different approaches: the first approach used is Tukey's IQR, the statistical method, the second is Isolation Forest (IF), the supervised learning method, and the last is the DBSCAN, the unsupervised learning method. Among the three, the highest outliers were detected by the IQR method.

This paper proposes an ontology-based approach with a hybrid ISO/IEC 11179 (MDR) and ISO/IEC 19763 (MFI) framework for data governance and integration. This framework takes a Global Ontology Model (GOM) constructed for the global domain as a bridge and basis for integrating and aligning heterogeneous sub domains. It extends MDR by adding ontology registration items to implement the mapping between the GOM and multiple subdomains, thereby promoting the semantic sharing of metadata between subdomains.

RwT reformulates knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) as a discrete decision-making problem, leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine reasoning paths. This approach mirrors human-like reasoning by dynamically integrating the LLM`s internal knowledge with external KG information. We propose a real-data guided iteration technique to train an evaluation model that assesses action values, improving the efficiency of the MCTS process. Experimental results on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RwT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average performance improvement of 9.81%.
