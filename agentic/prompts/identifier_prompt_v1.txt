Analyze the following SQL script to determine its primary command type and whether resolving full column-level lineage would require external context (like looking up table schemas in a database).

SQL Script:
```sql
{sql_content}
```

Consider these factors for `requires_context`:
- Does it use `SELECT *`? (Requires context)
- Is it an `INSERT` statement without an explicit column list? (Requires context)
- Is it a `COPY FROM` statement? (Requires context to know target columns)
- Is it a `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ...`? (May require context depending on the SELECT part)
- Does it use explicit column names everywhere? (Likely does not require context)

Identify the primary command type from this list (or determine if it's 'OTHER'):
- SELECT
- COPY
- INSERT
- CREATE_TABLE_AS
- UPDATE
- MERGE
- OTHER

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format:
{{
  "statement_type": "TYPE_FROM_LIST",
  "requires_context": true_or_false
}}
